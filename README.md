# AprilTagIdentifier

Project that is able to take live video feed, and identify all present apriltags (family, number and pose). Code for this project can easily be implemented in ROS2 node to run on robots (eg. Turtlebot4) and on simulation software (eg. Gazebo, PyBullet, WeBots).

AprilTag is a fidual marker system developed by the APRIL Robotics Lab from the University of Michigan. These tags are useful for robotics and camera calibration. This project that I created is part of the larger work ARCO Labs at McMaster University under the management of Dr. Giamou. AprilTagIdentifier is a small step towards the eventual goal of having an autonomous fleet of drones to map subterranean environments.
